# Changelog

## v0.4.7 — 2026-03-21

Fix texture orientation on generated blocks — faces showed different cropped regions of the texture because position-based UV mapping sampled different texture areas depending on element placement within the 0–16 coordinate space.

### Origin-Based Auto-UV
- `DynamicBlockModel.computeDefaultUV()` — replaced vanilla position-based UV calculation with origin-based `[0, 0, faceWidth, faceHeight]` mapping. Every face now samples the texture from (0,0) scaled to its actual dimensions, giving consistent visual appearance across all elements.

### Backend Prompt Update
- `prompt.ts` (theblockacademy repo) — replaced vague UV guideline with explicit origin-based UV instructions and worked example, so Claude generates UVs matching the client's auto-calculation.

## v0.4.6 — 2026-03-21

Fix invisible textures on generated blocks — faces rendered correct outlines/shapes but were invisible due to missing render layer and unmerged parent textures.

### Render Layer Registration
- `ShapeCraftClient` — register all 64 pool blocks with `RenderType.cutout()` via `BlockRenderLayerMap`. Without this, blocks defaulted to SOLID render layer which discards transparent textures entirely.

### Parent Texture Inheritance Fix
- `DynamicBlockModel.bakeQuads()` — always merge parent textures via `putIfAbsent` even when the model has inline elements. Previously parent textures were only merged when elements came from the parent, leaving `#variable` references unresolved → null sprites → invisible faces.

### Diagnostics
- `DynamicBlockModel.resolveSprite()` — log warning when a `#variable` texture reference can't be resolved, making texture issues immediately diagnosable
- Downgraded v0.4.4 per-element/per-vertex diagnostic logging from `info` to `debug` to reduce log spam

## v0.4.5 — 2026-03-21

Fix block outline shape not syncing to clients — outlines showed full cube on the client side because PoolBlockEntity lacked vanilla block entity sync methods.

### Client-Side Block Entity Sync
- `PoolBlockEntity` — added `getUpdatePacket()` and `getUpdateTag()` overrides to enable vanilla block entity client sync (sends SlotIndex, DisplayName, ModelJson via `saveWithoutMetadata()`)
- `PoolBlock.setPlacedBy()` — added `sendBlockUpdated()` call after setting model data, triggering the client-bound block entity packet

This covers all sync scenarios: block placement (including multiplayer broadcast), chunk load, and player join.

## v0.4.4 — 2026-03-21

Fix block selection outline showing full cube instead of model-accurate bounds on first placement.

### Block Outline Shape Fix
- `PoolBlock` — added `slotIndex` field so each pool block knows its slot; `setPlacedBy()` copies model data from `BlockPoolManager` to the `PoolBlockEntity` at placement time
- `PoolBlockEntity.setModelJson()` — now calls `computeShape()` immediately instead of just nullifying cached shape, ensuring VoxelShape is ready for outline rendering
- `ShapeCraft` registration loop passes slot index `i` to `PoolBlock` constructor

Previously, placed blocks had no model data in their entity until world reload (NBT round-trip), so `getShape()` fell back to a full 1×1×1 cube.

## v0.4.3 — 2026-03-21

Fix ModelValidator rejecting `comment` keys in elements; add diagnostic logging for cross-model rendering offset.

### Bug Fixes
- `ModelValidator` — added `"comment"` to `VALID_ELEMENT_KEYS` set so Claude-generated documentation fields no longer trigger V-002 errors
- Backend prompt — added guideline #9 discouraging extra keys in elements (defense-in-depth)

### Debug Diagnostics
- `DynamicBlockModel.bakeQuads()` — temporary diagnostic logging for cross/rotated model rendering offset investigation:
  - Logs parent resolution, element count, and rotation per slot
  - Logs per-element from/to coordinates and element rotation details
  - Logs first element's auto-computed UV values when `computeDefaultUV` is invoked
  - Logs first quad (UP face) vertex positions to verify block-local coordinate range

## v0.4.2 — 2026-03-21

Fix invisible blocks when Claude generates parent-only models (no inline elements).

### Parent Model Resolution
- `ParentResolver` — lazy-loaded singleton registry of 50 pre-computed parent models with resolved elements and texture maps
- `parent_models.json` — bundled resource (~50KB) with flattened geometry for all `KNOWN_PARENTS`
- `DynamicBlockModel.bakeQuads()` — falls back to `ParentResolver` when model has `parent` but no `elements`; merges parent texture map (child overrides via `putIfAbsent`)
- `PoolBlockEntity.computeShape()` — same parent resolution fallback for collision shapes
- Ambient occlusion inherited from resolved parent when child doesn't set it
- Backend prompt updated to require inline `elements` (defense-in-depth; client-side resolution handles legacy/unexpected parent-only models)

## v0.4.1 — 2026-03-20

Fix block textures being replaced with distorted cobblestone/water after generation.

### Self-Validating Baked Model Cache
- `BakedModelCache` tracks a reload generation counter — incremented on every resource reload (atlas rebuild)
- `BakedSlotData` stores the generation at bake time; `getQuads()` returns null for stale entries (generation mismatch)
- `DynamicBakedModel.getQuads()` lazy-rebakes from `ModelCache` using the current atlas when cache is empty or stale
- This makes the system resilient to atlas rebuilds regardless of when/why they happen (F3+T, server resource packs, mod-triggered reloads)
- `ShapeCraftModelPlugin.onInitializeModelLoader()` increments reload generation on each resource reload
- `DynamicBlockModel.bake()` remains a thin delegate (no cache write) — `RuntimeModelBaker` and lazy-rebake are the only writers
- Removed `RuntimeModelBaker.rebakeAll()` and resource reload listener from `ShapeCraftClient` (superseded by lazy rebaking)

## v0.4.0 — 2026-03-20

Eliminate resource reload on block generation — no more loading screen.

### Runtime Model Hot-Swap
- `BakedModelCache` — shared mutable store of baked quad data keyed by slot index, thread-safe via ConcurrentHashMap
- `RuntimeModelBaker` — bakes model JSON into BakedModelCache at runtime using existing block atlas sprites, no reload needed
- `DynamicBakedModel` refactored to delegate to BakedModelCache by (slotIndex, facing) — picks up new quads on next `getQuads()` call
- `DynamicBlockModel.bakeQuads()` extracted as public static method for reuse by both reload path and runtime hot-swap
- `ShapeCraftModelPlugin` always creates delegate models (empty slots render invisible instead of stone fallback)
- `ShapeCraftClientNetworking` uses `RuntimeModelBaker.bakeAndCache()` + `levelRenderer.allChanged()` instead of `reloadResourcePacks()`
- Block sync on join uses `bakeAndCacheBatch()` for single chunk re-mesh across all synced blocks
- F3+T and resource pack changes still work via normal `ShapeCraftModelPlugin` → `bake()` path

## v0.3.0 — 2026-03-20

Backend integration — Phases 6–10 implemented. Full end-to-end generation pipeline.

### Phase 6 — Backend API Routes (theblockacademy)

- Auth middleware (`shapecraftAuth.ts`) — Bearer token validation with `shape_` prefix
- Trial provisioning (`/shapecraft/trial`) — auto-provisions 50-generation trial per server
- License activation (`/shapecraft/activate`) — `SHAPE-XXXX-XXXX` code format, 30-day licenses
- License validation (`/shapecraft/validate`) — state checking, monthly counter reset
- Generation endpoint (`/shapecraft/generate`) — Claude Sonnet 4.6 with RAG retrieval via Voyage embeddings + pgvector, content filter, atomic trial deduction, retry on malformed JSON
